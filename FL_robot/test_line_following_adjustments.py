Test script to verify line following adjustments and end-of-trial behavior

This script tests:
1. Line following search: 5.5s right turn, then 2.7s left recenter
2. End-of-trial behavior: returns to START state instead of MANUAL_CONTROL
3. GUI integration: trial progress tied to robot control panel
