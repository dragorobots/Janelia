# Line Following Final Adjustments

## Overview
This document summarizes the final adjustments made to the line following search behavior and end-of-trial behavior based on user feedback.

## Changes Made

### 1. Line Following Search Adjustments

**Previous Behavior:**
- Left turn: 2.7s (90°)
- Right turn: 8.1s (270° - 3x more turning)
- Total search: 360°

**New Behavior:**
- Left turn: 2.7s (90°)
- Right turn: 5.5s (189° - user specified)
- If line not found: 2.7s left recenter (93°)
- Total search: 374° (90° + 189° + 93°)

**Implementation Details:**
- Modified `SEARCH_DURATION_RIGHT` from 8.1s to 5.5s in `hide_and_seek.py`
- Added `recenter_attempt` logic to attempt a 2.7s left turn if line not found after right turn
- Updated log messages to reflect the new search sequence
- Initialized `recenter_attempt = False` when starting new searches

**Search Sequence:**
1. Turn left for 2.7s (90°)
2. Turn right for 5.5s (user specified)
3. If line not found, turn left for 2.7s to recenter
4. If still not found, stop and proceed to next state

### 2. End-of-Trial Behavior

**Previous Behavior:**
- Trial complete → `MANUAL_CONTROL` state
- Required manual intervention to exit manual control
- Robot remained in manual driving mode

**New Behavior:**
- Trial complete → `START` state
- Robot returns to idle state waiting for next trial
- Camera sits idle, ready for next 'Start Trial' command
- Seamless transition between trials

**Implementation Details:**
- Modified `execute_reset_phase()` in `hide_and_seek.py`
- Changed `self.main_state = RobotState.MANUAL_CONTROL` to `self.main_state = RobotState.START`
- Added informative log message: "Returned to START state. Camera idle, waiting for next 'Start Trial' command."

### 3. GUI Integration

**Enhanced Trial Instructions:**
- Added "Robot Trial Progress" section to the instructions
- Integrated robot progress steps with user setup steps
- Clear visual connection between user actions and robot state

**Progress Integration:**
- Trial progress indicators serve as guide for user
- Instructions include robot trial progress steps
- User can see both setup steps and robot progress

## Files Modified

### `hide_and_seek.py`
- **Line 102**: Changed `SEARCH_DURATION_RIGHT` from 8.1s to 5.5s
- **Lines 530-550**: Updated search logic with recenter attempt
- **Lines 516, 618**: Added `recenter_attempt = False` initialization
- **Lines 620-625**: Modified `execute_reset_phase()` to return to START state

### `ktom_experimenter.py`
- **Lines 698-723**: Enhanced trial instructions with robot progress integration

## Benefits

1. **More Precise Line Following**: 5.5s right turn provides better balance between thoroughness and efficiency
2. **Recenter Attempt**: Additional 2.7s left turn helps robot find the line if initial search fails
3. **Seamless Trial Transitions**: Robot automatically returns to ready state for next trial
4. **Better User Experience**: No need to manually exit manual control mode between trials
5. **Clear Progress Tracking**: GUI shows both user setup steps and robot progress

## Testing

Created `test_line_following_adjustments.py` to verify:
- Line following search durations and angles
- End-of-trial behavior changes
- GUI integration improvements

**Test Results:**
- Left turn: 2.7s = 92.8°
- Right turn: 5.5s = 189.1°
- Recenter left: 2.7s = 92.8°
- Total search: 374.7°

## User Feedback Addressed

✅ **"Make it only turn for a total of 5.5 seconds to the right"**
- Changed `SEARCH_DURATION_RIGHT` to 5.5s

✅ **"If it does not find the line, attempt to recenter by turning to the left by 2.7 seconds"**
- Added recenter attempt logic

✅ **"At the end of the trial, do not switch to manual driving. Rather revert to the 'im in the start' state"**
- Modified end-of-trial behavior to return to START state

✅ **"Change the Trial progress to be more directly tied to the robot control panel now"**
- Enhanced GUI integration with robot progress steps
