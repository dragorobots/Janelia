## üñ•Ô∏è **Step 1: Setting Up Your Windows PC**

### **1.1 Install Required Software**

#### **Install Python (if not already installed)**
1. Open **Command Prompt** (Press Windows key + R, type `cmd`, press Enter)
2. Check if Python is installed:
   ```cmd
   python --version
   ```
3. If you see a version number (like "Python 3.9.0"), you're good!
4. If not, install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - **Important**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

#### **Install Git (if not already installed)**
1. In Command Prompt, check if Git is installed:
   ```cmd
   git --version
   ```
2. If you see a version number, you're good!
3. If not, install Git:
   - **Option A (Recommended)**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   - **Option B**: Use winget (if available):
     ```cmd
     winget install Git.Git
     ```
   - **Option C**: Use Chocolatey (if you have it installed):
     ```cmd
     choco install git
     ```

#### **Verify Git Installation**
After installing Git, run:
```cmd
git --version
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### **1.2 Download the Robot Software**

1. Open Command Prompt
2. Navigate to your Documents folder:
   ```cmd
   cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents
   ```
3. Download the robot software:
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/dragorobots/Janelia.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the robot folder:
   ```cmd
   cd Janelia\FL_robot
   ```

### **1.3 Install Python Packages**

1. In Command Prompt (still in the FL_robot folder), run:
   ```cmd
   first_boot_pc.bat
   ```

**What this does:**
- Installs all necessary Python packages
- Sets up the GUI interface
- Tests that everything works

**You should see:**
- ‚úÖ All packages installing successfully
- ‚úÖ "Setup completed successfully!" message
- ‚úÖ "k-ToM GUI is ready to use!" message

## ü§ñ **Step 2: Setting Up Your Robot**

### **2.1 Connect to Your Robot via RealVNC**

1. Open **RealVNC Viewer** on your Windows PC
2. Connect to your robot using the IP address provided by your lab
3. You should see the robot's desktop

### **2.2 Access the Robot's Terminal**

1. In RealVNC, open a terminal window
2. You should see a command prompt like: `root@robot:~#`

### **2.3 Install Git on Robot (if not already installed)**

1. In the robot's terminal, check if Git is installed:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

2. If Git is not installed, install it:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install git -y
   ```

3. Configure Git on the robot:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Robot"
   git config --global user.email "robot@lab.com"
   ```

### **2.4 Install Robot Software**

1. In the robot's terminal, navigate to the workspace:
   ```bash
   cd /root/yahboomcar_ws/src
   ```

2. Download the robot software:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dragorobots/Janelia.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the robot folder:
   ```bash
   cd Janelia/FL_robot
   ```

4. Install all robot packages:
   ```bash
   chmod +x first_boot_robot.sh
   ./first_boot_robot.sh
   ```

**What this does:**
- Installs ROS2 (robot operating system)
- Installs Python packages for robot control
- Sets up camera and sensor access
- Tests that everything works

**You should see:**
- ‚úÖ "Robot setup completed successfully!" message
- ‚úÖ All packages installing without errors

### **2.5 Set Up Git Access (One-time setup)**

1. In the robot's terminal, generate an SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "robot-setup" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""
   ```

2. Display the public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

3. Copy the entire output (starts with "ssh-ed25519" and ends with "robot-setup")

4. **On your Windows PC**, open a web browser and go to [GitHub SSH Keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)

5. Click "New SSH key"
6. Give it a title like "Robot SSH Key"
7. Paste the key you copied from the robot
8. Click "Add SSH key"

### **2.6 Configure Robot for Git Access**

1. Back in the robot's terminal, test the connection:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

2. You should see: "Hi dragorobots! You've successfully authenticated..."

3. Set up the robot's working directory:
   ```bash
   cd /root/yahboomcar_ws/src
   mv yahboomcar_astra/hide_and_seek yahboomcar_astra/hide_and_seek.backup
   ln -s /root/yahboomcar_ws/src/Janelia/FL_robot yahboomcar_astra/hide_and_seek
   ```

## üîß **Step 3: Finding Your Robot's IP Address**

### **3.1 Get the Robot's IP Address**

1. In the robot's terminal, run:
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```

2. You'll see something like: `10.0.0.234 192.168.1.100`
3. **Write down the first IP address** (this is your robot's IP)

### **3.2 Test Connection from Your Windows PC**

1. On your Windows PC, open Command Prompt
2. Test if you can reach the robot:
   ```cmd
   ping YOUR_ROBOT_IP
   ```
   (Replace YOUR_ROBOT_IP with the IP you wrote down)

3. You should see responses like "Reply from YOUR_ROBOT_IP: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=64"

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **"Git not found"**
- **On Windows**: Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- **On Robot**: Run `sudo apt install git -y`

#### **"Python not found"**
- Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Restart Command Prompt after installation

#### **"Connection Failed"**
- Check robot IP address is correct
- Ensure robot system is running (`./start_hide_and_seek.sh`)
- Verify network connection: `ping YOUR_ROBOT_IP`

#### **"Robot not moving"**
- Check if robot is in manual mode
- Ensure line following is enabled
- Verify camera is working

#### **"Camera not working"**
- Start camera server: `./setup_camera_server.sh`
- Check camera permissions
- Restart robot system

#### **"GUI won't start"**
- Ensure Python packages are installed: `first_boot_pc.bat`
- Check Python version: `python --version`
- Restart Command Prompt and try again

#### **"Robot software errors"**
- Update robot software:
  ```bash
  cd /root/yahboomcar_ws/src/Janelia/FL_robot
  ./update_robot.sh
  ```
- Restart robot system

#### **"Package installation errors on robot"**
- If you see errors like "Unable to locate package" during robot setup:
  - This is normal for some Linux distributions
  - The script will continue and install packages via pip instead
  - Look for "‚ö†Ô∏è" warnings - these are expected and not errors
  - If the script completes successfully, you can proceed
  - If the script fails completely, try running it again:
    ```bash
    cd /root/yahboomcar_ws/src/Janelia/FL_robot
    ./first_boot_robot.sh
    ```

### **Emergency Stop**

**If the robot is moving unexpectedly:**
1. Press **"üö® ABORT MISSION"** button in GUI
2. Or press **Escape** key
3. Or press **Ctrl+A** in the GUI

**If the robot is completely unresponsive:**
1. In RealVNC, open terminal
2. Run: `pkill -f hide_and_seek`
3. Restart robot system

## üìö **Advanced Features**

### **Color Measurement Tool**

To calibrate line colors:
1. On your Windows PC, run:
   ```cmd
   python color_measurer.py --ip YOUR_ROBOT_IP --port 8080
   ```
2. Use the tool to measure line colors
3. Update color values in the robot software

### **Manual Control Mode**

1. In GUI, set "Drive Mode" to "Manual Drive"
2. Use arrow keys or WASD to control robot manually
3. Useful for testing and debugging

### **Different k-Levels**

- **k=0**: Robot assumes rat is random
- **k=1**: Robot assumes rat thinks robot is random
- **k=2**: Robot assumes rat thinks robot thinks rat is random
- **k=3**: More sophisticated reasoning
